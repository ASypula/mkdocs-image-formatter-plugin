### Description:

The plugin allows you to define image size categories and use them as tags in your documentation. The images annotated with tags will be resized to the size specified in the configuration file.

### (Planned) Usage:

#### Step 1.

To configuration file add:

```
plugins:
    - image_formatter:
        image_size:
            <tag_name>:
                width: <size>
                height: <size>
            <tag_name>:
                width: <size>
                height: <size>
```

where different `tag_names` are the names of image size categories. Remember about measurement units (`px, %, etc.`) when specifying width and height.

Example of correct configuration:

```
plugins:
  - <your other plugins>
  - image-formatter:
      image_size:
        small:
          height: 100px
          width: 100px
        big:
          height: 200px
          width: 200px
```

#### Step 2:

Annotate images in your documents with desired tags.

Example:

```
@small
(../images/b.png)
```
