### Description:

The plugin allows you to define image size categories and use them as tags in your documentation. The images annotated with tags will be resized to the size specified in the configuration file.

### Installation:
You can install the plugin using pip: `pip install mkdocs-image-formatter-plugin`


### Usage:

#### Prerequisites
Plugin works by replacing your tags with attribute list that is later interpreted by `attr_list` markdown extension. Make sure you add it to `mkdocs.yaml` like so:
```
markdown_extensions:
  - attr_list
```


#### Step 1.

To configuration file add:

```
- image_formatter:
    image_size:
        <tag_name>:
            width: <size>
            height: <size>
        <tag_name>:
            width: <size>
            height: <size>
```

where different `tag_names` are the names of image size categories. Remember about measurement units (`px, %, etc.`) when specifying width and height.

Example of correct configuration:

```
markdown_extensions:
    - attr_list

plugins:
    - image-formatter:
        image_size:
            small:
                height: 100px
                width: 100px
            big:
                height: 200px
                width: 200px
```


#### Step 2:

Annotate images in your documents with desired tags.

Example:

```
![MyImage]@small(../images/b.png)
```
